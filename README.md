# 6G Cell-Free & RIS Simulation 📡

Interactive 3D visualization of a 6G Cell-Free architecture enhanced with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). Users are dynamically connected to Access Points directly or via reflecting elements to maximize signal quality and coverage in an urban environment.

This project was built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Three.js** (`@react-three/fiber`), and **Vite**.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally (Windows)

If you've just cloned this repository to a Windows laptop, follow these steps to get the 3D simulation running locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

You will need **Node.js** installed on your computer to run the Javascript tooling. 
- Download and install the latest LTS version for Windows from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/).
- Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt (`cmd`) or PowerShell and typing:
  ```powershell
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
  *(Both should return version numbers).*

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.

```powershell
cd path\to\random_project
```

Then, run the following command to download all the required packages (like Three.js, React, Framer Motion, etc.):

```powershell
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, you can start the local development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 4. View the Simulation 🌐

After running the command, Vite will provide a localized URL in your terminal. It will usually look like this:

```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in 450 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

- Hold **`Ctrl`** and click the `http://localhost:5173/` link in your terminal, *or*
- Open your preferred web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) and paste `http://localhost:5173/` into the address bar.

That's it! The 3D simulation should now be fully interactive in your browser.
